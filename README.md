Welcome to the KallistiOS PVR API Only Example repository!

## About

This repository contains examples demonstrating how to use the KallistiOS PVR API directly. It focuses solely on the PVR API, without using any additional layers such as OpenGL, SDL, or Parallax. These examples are intended to provide straightforward solutions for common tasks using the KallistiOS PVR API.

## Features

- **Direct KallistiOS PVR API Usage:** No additional layers, pure PVR API examples.
- **Texture Handling:** Loading and displaying textures.
- **Zoom Effects:** Implementing zoom-in and zoom-out effects controlled by controller inputs.
- **3D PVR Cube Example:** Demonstrating texture and matrix usage for 3D rendering.
- **Clear and Commented Code:** Easy to understand with comprehensive comments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run these examples, you'll need:

- A Dreamcast development environment set up with KallistiOS.
- A compatible compiler (e.g., GCC).
- A Dreamcast console or emulator to test your builds or hardware serial or bba.
